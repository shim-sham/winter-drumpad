# winter drum pad ❄️
- inspiration from this hack club tutorial: https://workshops.hackclub.com/drum_pad/
- i added different colours, images, and sounds, as well as using lists instead of div to make it my own! (as well as the horizontally scrolling x-mas jokes)
- click on the pads or press keys on your keyboard to play different (christmas-y) sounds
- snowflakes fall when sounds are played
- includes christmas / winter jokes...
